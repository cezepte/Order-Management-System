# CHANGELOG
This file is meant to get you on track with whats going on inside of a project, it won't come out a [0.1.0] version or higher until it is ready to install for you as someone who wants to make a real use of it. Version [1.0.0] won't out until all services will be available.
Back-end is written in PHP without use of any framework, just plain PHP. Same goes for front-end - just JS with Bootstrap 5 (yeah I know it's using jQuery, don't judge me tho) on board to speed up the process.
