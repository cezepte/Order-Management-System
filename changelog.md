# CHANGELOG
This file is meant to get you on track with whats going on inside of a project, it won't come in a [0.1.0] version or higher until it is ready to install for you as someone who wants to make a real use of it. 
Back-end is written in PHP without use of any framework, just plain PHP. Same goes for front-end - just plain JS with Bootstrap 5 on board to speed up the process.
