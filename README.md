# Order Management System
## Description
### Basic order management system for small businesses and your local activity. Simple and easy to use as well as to install.
This application is written in PHP, JS, CSS & HTML. The complexity of backend operations makes it hard for single person to develop quickly. In new releases there will be coming new features, updates to the design and functionality as well as bug fixes and optimalization so it can run fast and efficiently. For know I want to focus on features. Developing them can make app more usable quicker and visual updates will come more rarely than backend.
This tool allows you to:
- store all of your orders in one place
- keep track of your finances
- store all of your clients and contractors data
- administrate your employees accounts
- make simple invoices
## Installation process
### 1. Create database
Go to your database administration tool such as phpmyadmin and create new database which will be used to store all of your data from the app
### 2. Open the index.php file in the browser
There you should be good to go. All the process is described in the windows which is showed to you as you load it. You'll be ask for your credentials to administrate the database and create an account which will be used as an admin account of yours.
## Thanks for checking out my project!
I'd be really glad if you leave a comment about what you like and not like about the app. It will for sure help me develop both the app and my programming skills!
